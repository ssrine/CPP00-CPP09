#C++ Learning Project
Welcome to my C++ learning project! In this repository, I document my journey of learning the C++ programming language, starting from the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to exploring various features of the C++ Standard Library (std).

#**Getting Started**

#About C++
C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that builds upon the foundation of the C programming language while introducing features such as OOP, templates, and standard libraries. Understanding C++ opens up opportunities for developing high-performance software, system programming, game development, and much more.

#Difference between C and C++
While C and C++ share many similarities, there are significant differences between the two languages. C++ introduces features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling that are not present in C. These features make C++ a more versatile and object-oriented language compared to C.

#C++98
C++98 refers to the version of the C++ programming language standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998. It was the first standardized version of C++, introducing many of the features that are commonly associated with modern C++. Despite being an older version, C++98 is still relevant today and forms the foundation for later versions of the language.

#Namespaces
Namespaces provide a way to organize code into logical groups and avoid naming conflicts. They are used to encapsulate declarations and definitions, preventing name clashes between different parts of a program or between libraries.

#References
References in C++ provide an alternative way to access variables. They are similar to pointers but offer a more convenient syntax and are safer to use in many cases. References are often used in function parameters to pass arguments by reference, allowing functions to modify the original variables.

#**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts of OOP include:

#Classes
*Classes**are user-defined data types that encapsulate data (attributes) and operations (methods) into a single unit. They serve as blueprints for creating objects, allowing for code reuse and abstraction.
Inheritance

*Inheritance* is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Virtual Functions

*Virtual* functions are functions declared in a base class and overridden in derived classes. They enable polymorphic behavior, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through pointers or references to the base class.
Polymorphism

*Polymorphism* allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code by providing a way to write code that can operate on objects of various types without knowing their exact types at compile time.
Exception Handling

#C++ Standard Library (std)
The C++ Standard Library (std) provides a rich collection of classes and functions for various tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, containers, algorithms, and more. Some key components of the C++ Standard Library include:

*IOStreams* Input/output stream classes for handling console input/output and file operations.

*Exception* handling is a mechanism for dealing with runtime errors and exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. It allows code to gracefully handle errors, recover from them, and maintain program stability.
Type Casting

*Type casting* allows converting one data type into another. It can be explicit (static_cast, dynamic_cast) or implicit (e.g., int to float), and it enables interoperability between different data types.
Templates

*Templates* are a powerful feature of C++ that allow writing generic code to work with any data type. They enable code reuse and improve code efficiency by allowing algorithms and data structures to be written once and used with different types.
C++ Standard Library (STL) and Containers
Standard Template Library (STL)

#**Standard Template Library (STL)**

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful part of the C++ Standard Library that provides generic algorithms and data structures. It consists of several components:

Containers: Data structures that store collections of objects. Examples include vectors, lists, queues, stacks, maps, and sets.
Algorithms: A collection of generic algorithms for operations such as sorting, searching, and manipulation of elements in containers.
Iterators: Objects used to traverse and access the elements of containers in a generic way, allowing algorithms to work with different types of containers.
Function Objects (Functors): Objects that can be called as if they were functions, allowing greater flexibility in algorithm implementation.

Containers

Containers are a fundamental part of the STL and provide data structures for storing collections of objects. Some commonly used containers include:

Vector: A dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size.
List: A doubly linked list that allows efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position.
Map: An associative container that stores key-value pairs and allows efficient lookup of values based on keys.
Set: An associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order.
