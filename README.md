## Getting Started

### About C++

C++ stands as a testament to versatility and power in the realm of programming languages. It inherits the robustness of its predecessor, C, while introducing modern features like OOP, templates, and standard libraries. Mastering C++ opens the doors to a myriad of possibilities, from building high-performance software to crafting intricate game engines.

### Difference between C and C++

While C and C++ share a common heritage, the latter distinguishes itself through the introduction of groundbreaking features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling. These additions transform C++ into a more expressive, object-oriented language tailored for modern software development.

### C++98

C++98 marks the genesis of standardized C++, paving the way for subsequent versions. Despite its age, C++98 remains relevant, laying the foundation for the language's evolution and embodying timeless principles that underpin modern C++ development.

### Namespaces

Namespaces serve as organizational constructs, providing a mechanism to encapsulate declarations and definitions. They mitigate naming conflicts and enhance code modularity by segregating components into logical groups.

### References

References offer a convenient and safe alternative to pointers, facilitating efficient variable access. Widely used in function parameters, references enable functions to manipulate variables directly, fostering cleaner and more readable code.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts of OOP include:
### Classes

Classes epitomize the essence of OOP, encapsulating data and behavior into cohesive units. They furnish blueprints for object creation, enabling code reusability and abstraction.

### Inheritance

Inheritance empowers classes to inherit properties and behaviors from their ancestors, fostering code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships within codebases.

### Virtual Functions

Virtual functions enable polymorphic behavior, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. They promote flexibility and extensibility by facilitating dynamic method resolution at runtime.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism embodies the essence of flexibility in object-oriented design, permitting objects of diverse types to be treated uniformly. It fosters code adaptability and extensibility, empowering developers to write versatile and scalable software solutions.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling provides a robust mechanism for managing runtime errors and exceptional conditions. It ensures program stability by gracefully handling unexpected situations, facilitating error recovery and fault tolerance.

## C++ Standard Library (std)
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful part of the C++ Standard Library that provides generic algorithms and data structures. It consists of several components:
### IOStreams

IOStreams furnish a comprehensive framework for handling input/output operations, encompassing console interactions and file manipulations.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling augments program robustness by providing a structured mechanism for handling runtime errors and exceptional conditions.

### Type Casting

Type casting enables seamless conversion between different data types, facilitating interoperability and enhancing code flexibility.

### Templates

Templates empower developers to write generic code that operates seamlessly across various data types. They foster code reuse and improve efficiency by enabling algorithms and data structures to adapt dynamically to different contexts.

## Standard Template Library (STL) and Containers

### Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) stands as a cornerstone of modern C++ development, offering a plethora of generic algorithms and data structures. It comprises essential components such as containers, algorithms, iterators, and function objects.

### Containers

Containers serve as the building blocks of the STL, providing versatile data structures for storing and manipulating collections of objects. From dynamic arrays (vectors) to associative containers (maps and sets), containers facilitate efficient data management and retrieval.
